# Chrome Install Bash Installer
This bash script installs Google Chrome for you without the need of a browser. It also checks if Google Chrome is already installed on your system.

This repository is explained more in-depth in my blog post here: https://blog.azazelm3dj3d.com/installing-google-chrome-on-kali-linux-using-bash-script/

## Usage

Make sure the bash script has executable permissions.
```bash
chmod +x chrome_install.sh
```

Run the bash script from a terminal running `/bin/bash` or similar.
```bash
./chrome_install.sh
```
