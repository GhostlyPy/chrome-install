# Chrome Install
This bash script will install Google Chrome for you without the need of a browser. It also checks if Google Chrome is already installed on your system.

This repository is explained more in-depth in my blog post here: https://hifumi1337.github.io/installing-google-chrome-on-kali-linux-using-bash-script/

## Usage
```bash
chmod +x chrome_install.sh
```

```bash
./chrome_install.sh
```
